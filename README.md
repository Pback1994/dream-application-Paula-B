Task #1

Application Summary – the application I would like to create is an interactive online tool designed for auditors to understand the regulatory compliance requirements of the loan estimate – a federally required form that outlines the key terms, costs, and details of a mortgage loan. By providing an intuitive, interactive experience, this application will help auditors efficiently review loan estimate documents, ensuring compliance with federal mortgage disclosure regulations. The tool will allow auditors to:

- Navigate through each section of the three-page loan estimate form.
- Click on specific sections to receive concise explanations of the applicable federal regulation.
- Access links to additional regulatory guidance for deeper insights into compliance requirements.

Task #2

Skills Summary – In order to build the application, I will need to apply the following skills:

- Organization and Time Management - Use a to-do list to plan out each component of the project that I would like to build and allocate time to complete each task via a calendar system.
- Value, Data Types, and Operations – String values will likely be needed to improve the usability of the application for auditors. Specifically, strings may be used to change button text from “Show More” to “Show Less” depending on whether the borrower wants to access more of the details in the accordion.
- The Growth Mindset – I aim to remain resilient and apply a growth mindset to continuously persist through expected challenges.
- Stringing Characters Together – For long explanations on a specific section of the accordion, I can limit the amount of text displayed using the .slice() string method and text that says “Read More” or something similar.
- Control Structures and Logic – “If”, “else”, and “else if” statements can be applied to manage the logic of the different accordion section of the loan estimate explainer.
- Working with Loops – For…of loops can be used to dynamically flip through sections of the array storing the title and content elements and display the information for users to see.
- Building Arrays – Arrays will be used to store the values of the title and content of each section of the accordion.
- Using Arrays – The forEach array method will be used to dynamically loop through the array storing the title and content elements of the accordion and
